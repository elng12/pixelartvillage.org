Subject: Featured [Tool Name] in Our Pixel Art Converter Comparison

Hi [Name],

I'm reaching out from Pixel Art Village. We just published an 
extensive comparison of 10 pixel art converters, including [Tool Name].

Article: https://pixelartvillage.org/blog/best-pixel-art-converters-compared-2025/

We tested each tool hands-on for privacy, features, and output quality. 
[Tool Name] scored [X/10] - we were particularly impressed by [specific feature].

Our comparison has already been well-received by the pixel art community 
on Reddit and Twitter. Would you be open to sharing it with your users? 
I think they'd find the detailed feature comparison valuable.

Also happy to add any updates if [Tool Name] has new features we should 
highlight!

Best regards,
[Your Name]

## 模板2：给像素艺术社区

Subject: Comprehensive Pixel Art Converter Comparison (Community Resource)

Hi [Community Manager/Moderator Name],

I'm reaching out from Pixel Art Village. We just published what we believe 
is the most comprehensive comparison of pixel art converters available:

https://pixelartvillage.org/blog/best-pixel-art-converters-compared-2025/

The guide covers:
• 10 major tools with hands-on testing
• Privacy analysis (client-side vs server processing)
• Feature comparison matrix
• Use-case recommendations
• Quality benchmarks

We created this as a community resource since we get a lot of questions 
from beginners about which tools to use. The [Community Name] community 
might find it useful too.

Would you consider:
- Sharing it in your newsletter/forum?
- Adding it to your resources page?
- Mentioning it in your Discord/community?

We're also open to feedback or suggestions for improving the guide!

Thanks for your consideration,
[Your Name]

## 模板3：给游戏开发博客/媒体

Subject: Story Pitch: Privacy Concerns in Pixel Art Tools

Hi [Editor Name],

Quick pitch: We tested 10 popular pixel art converters and discovered 
that most upload users' images to servers - a significant privacy risk 
for game developers working on unreleased projects.

Our comprehensive comparison:
https://pixelartvillage.org/blog/best-pixel-art-converters-compared-2025/

Key findings:
• Only 30% process images client-side (private)
• Many tools don't disclose their data handling
• Quality varies significantly despite similar marketing
• Price ≠ quality in this space

The article includes detailed scoring, methodology, and recommendations 
for different use cases (hobbyists vs professional game devs).

Would this interest your readers? Happy to provide additional insights 
or collaborate on a piece.

Best,
[Your Name]
Pixel Art Village
