I tested 10 pixel art converters and compared them - here's what I found [Guide]
```

**正文**：
```
Hey pixel artists!

I spent the last few weeks testing every major pixel art converter I could find. I wanted to create a resource I wish existed when I started.

**What I tested:**
• Privacy (client-side vs server processing)
• Feature set (palettes, dithering, export options)
• Output quality (with sample images)
• Ease of use for beginners vs pros

**Key findings:**
• Most web tools upload your images to servers (!)
• Only a few have Floyd-Steinberg dithering
• "Free" doesn't mean lower quality
• Different tools excel at different use cases

Made this comprehensive comparison guide with a scoring matrix:
https://pixelartvillage.org/blog/best-pixel-art-converters-compared-2025/

**TL;DR:** Tested 10 tools, scored each on 6 criteria, included use-case recommendations.

Happy to answer questions! What tools do you use?

```
Comprehensive comparison of pixel art converters for game devs (privacy, features, quality)
```

**正文**：
```
For game developers working on retro-style projects, I compared 10 pixel art conversion tools.

**Why I made this:**
I was frustrated finding converters that either:
• Upload my assets to unknown servers (security risk!)
• Produce low-quality output for sprites
• Lack batch processing capabilities

**What I evaluated:**
✓ Privacy (client-side processing vs uploads)
✓ Export formats (PNG, sprite sheets, etc.)
✓ Output quality for game sprites
✓ Dithering algorithms
✓ Color palette controls

**Results:**
Guide with scoring matrix and use-case recommendations:
https://pixelartvillage.org/blog/best-pixel-art-converters-compared-2025/

Includes sections specifically for:
• Professional game devs (need privacy + quality)
• Hobby projects (prioritize free + easy)
• Animation work (need sprite sheet support)

Questions welcome!

Why privacy matters in creative tools 🔒

I recently analyzed 10 popular pixel art converters and discovered:
• 70% upload user images to remote servers
• Most don't disclose their data handling practices  
• Few game developers are aware of this risk

For indie developers and studios working on unreleased projects, this poses a real security concern.

The solution? Client-side processing tools that keep your assets private.

I wrote a comprehensive comparison covering privacy, features, and quality:

Key takeaway: Free and private can coexist. We don't have to sacrifice privacy for convenience.

How I wrote a 4000-word comparison article to drive traffic to my pixel art tool
```

**正文**：
```
Background: I built a free pixel art converter (pixelartvillage.org) but struggled with SEO. Brand keywords ranked fine, but functional keywords ("image to pixel art") didn't.

**Strategy:**
Instead of only promoting MY tool, I created an honest comparison of ALL major competitors.

**What I did:**
1. Tested 10 tools hands-on (40+ hours)
2. Created objective scoring criteria (6 categories)
3. Wrote 4000-word guide with comparison matrix
4. Included competitors I actually respect
5. Disclosed my tool ownership upfront

**Why this works:**
• Targets high-intent keywords ("best [tool]")
• Builds trust through transparency
• Creates linkable asset (other sites reference it)
• Positions me as industry expert

**Early results:**

Show HN: I tested 10 pixel art converters and made a comparison guide
```

**正文**：

Hey HN,

I built a free pixel art converter (https://pixelartvillage.org) and wanted to understand the competitive landscape.

Instead of just studying competitors, I tested 10 tools hands-on and wrote a comprehensive comparison:
https://pixelartvillage.org/blog/best-pixel-art-converters-compared-2025/

Key findings:
• Most web-based tools upload images to servers (privacy issue)
• Quality varies wildly despite similar marketing
• Free doesn't always mean worse

I tried to be objective despite reviewing my own tool. Interested in your thoughts on:
1. The comparison methodology
2. Privacy in creative tools
3. Whether "honest comparison" content works for SEO

Built with React, 100% client-side processing (WebAssembly + Canvas API).

Happy to answer questions!
