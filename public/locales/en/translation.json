        "question": "What is the best way to convert a image to pixel art?",
        "answer": "For best results when you convert a image to pixel visuals, start with a high-contrast image. Use the pixel size slider to find a level of detail you like with custom palette settings. Create pixel art with larger sizes for a more abstract, 8-bit look, while smaller sizes retain more detail from the original image with advanced palettes."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use the generated pixel art commercially?",
        "answer": "Yes. You own the rights to your original uploads and to the generated results. You can use graphics made with pixel Village for any purpose, including commercial projects. Create pixel art with our tools for unlimited commercial use."
