      {
        "question": "The site shows a blank page or crashes — what should I do?",
        "answer": "Some browser extensions inject development runtimes (e.g., Plasmo/BacklinkPilot) into every page, which can break React apps. Please disable those extensions on this site and hard‑refresh (Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+R)."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is this digital image maker with palette controls free?",
        "answer": "Yes. Image Art Village is a completely free online image tool for all users. Enjoy unlimited image conversions, custom palette controls, and high-resolution downloads with advanced palettes without any cost."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is my image private? Do you upload image files?",
        "answer": "Your image privacy is guaranteed. Your image files never leave your device as all image processing is done locally in your browser. Image Art Village cannot access your image files, making it a secure digital image creator from your images with palette options."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I turn a image into a game sprite with custom palette?",
        "answer": "Our digital image maker with palette controls is perfect for creating game sprites. Upload your character's image, adjust the size to match your game's art style, and use the custom palette controls to fit your engine's color limits. Advanced palettes help you create the perfect sprite as a transparent PNG."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I adjust the pixel grid on my image?",
        "answer": "Absolutely. The live editor includes a \"Show grid\" option. This pixel grid overlay helps you see the individual pixels clearly, which is useful for fine-tuning your art or for learning how the pixelation effect works on your image."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the best way to convert a image to pixel art?",
        "answer": "For best results when you convert a image to pixel art, start with a high-contrast image. Use the pixel size slider to find a level of detail you like with custom palette settings. A larger pixel size creates a more abstract, 8-bit look, while a smaller size retains more detail from the original image with advanced palettes."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use the generated pixel art commercially?",
        "answer": "Yes. You own the rights to your original uploads and to the generated results. You can use graphics made with pixel art Village for any purpose, including commercial projects."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which formats can I use with this image pixelator?",
        "answer": "This image pixelator supports all common browser formats like PNG, JPG, GIF, and WEBP. You can convert a PNG to pixel art or a JPG to pixel art with ease."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why is this tool called pixel art Village?",
        "answer": "We believe that creating graphics is a community activity, even when using a tool online. pixel art Village is a place where anyone, from beginner to pro, can gather to easily make pixel art with custom palettes. We aim to build a welcoming village for all pixel art enthusiasts."
